This repository includes my ML projects in supervised learning(linear regression,Logistic regression,KNN,SVM),unsupervised learning(KMeans clustering) and Deep learning.
I used Jupyter notebook,Google Colab for writing codes and python libraries sklearn,Tensorflow,Keras etc for training the models.
